	<h2>The Story Behind</h2>
	<p>Living in Bangalore, I was not happy with the bus services of the city. The buses are always crowded and never on time, if there was a way to track buses and know exactly where they were, would save a lot of time . This is a problem faced by many people who regularly use the bus services.
<br><br>
<p>Though most buses in Bangalore do not have a GPS, yet the bus drivers have smart phones with location services. I used the cellular tracking or the GPS of the phone to track the bus instead. So instead of tracking the bus I track the driver using his cellphone. I can track his movements using the geolocation API. All the movement are tracked in realtime and sent to the server, where changes are constantly updated and displayed on a live bus map that integrates all the different bus movements. The map accurate and would be easily accessible to any user who wishes to view the location of a bus.
