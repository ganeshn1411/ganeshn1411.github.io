	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>DViz is a broadly applicable data visualization tool to help assess disease risk and explore related interventions that may be the most appropriate for a patient. 
	It integrates statistical dimensionality reduction methods with information visualization. 
	The tool is currently designed to help clinicians quickly, easily and visually understand their patients.</p>
	<h2>Problem</h2>
	<p>Assessing and responding to patients' risk are complex, high-dimensional information processing problems faced by time-constrained clinicians.
	It is hard for a doctor to effectively manage their patients and prioritize the high risk ones. 
	A more proactive approach might help identify complications in advance leading to better care.</p> 
	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>	Innovative algorithms and tools which combine statistical machine learning, information visualization and electronic health data may reduce clinicians' information processing load 
	and improve their ability to assess risk of disease onset and related complications. 
	A critical element in visualization is the incorporation of flexibility in customizing assessments to the needs of unique patient populations.</p>
	<h2>Data</h2>
	<p>We conducted a preliminary study to evaluate computationally driven visualization techniques for improving risk assessment using high dimensional data on 8,611 patients with diabetes.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>We have built a tool that uses tecnhiques of dimensionaly reduction along with information visualization.<br>
	It has the following features:</p>
