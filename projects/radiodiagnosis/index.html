	<h2>Problem</h2>
	<p>While the requirement for radiologists is increasing day by day, there is a huge supply demand gap due to the dearth of radiologists.    
	In addition, there are discrepencies in diagnosis among various doctors.
	An automated system to detect tumor cells can be a tool to assist doctors in faster cancer identification enabling them to cater to wider population.</p> 
	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>Supervised Learning techniques to classify a given cell as a cancer cell or not can be used to identify cancer cells. 
	The solution presented here uses Support Vector Machines to achieve the classification.</p>
	<h2>Data</h2>
	<p>The data involved labelled set of 500 images obtained from MRI scans of brain. 90 out of the 500 images actually had a tumor.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>The data was randomized and split into training, cross-validation and test sets in 70:20:10 ratio. 
	Different Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines were tried.
	RBF Kernel Support Vactor Machines perfomed the best giving an accuracy of about 90% on the test dataset.
