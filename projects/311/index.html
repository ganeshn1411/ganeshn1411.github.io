			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Emergency response management is a crucial element in effective manangement of city. 
			In a city like New York, the scale of this problem just keeps growing and traditional ways of manageing an increasing demand is not easy.
			Our project uses techniques of machine learning to provide a system that can help city administration a better way manage their emergency response systems like 311.</p>
			<h2>Data</h2>
			<p>Our data consisted of 311 calls for the past 10 years with description of each call like complaint type, location, agency that handled, time of response etc.</p>
			<h2>Approach</h2>
			<p>Given the problem to optimize resource allocation for 311 response, 
			we translated this problem into predicting the number of complaints of a type in a borough for a given period of time. 
			In addition to the 311 data, we considered input features like weather as most of the 311 complaints were weather related.
			We tried different regression models to predict the number of complaits of a given type at a given location and time using these input features.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Time of the day, day of week and month seemed to have significant correlation with the number of complaints. 
			In addition, adding weather based features helped us achieve a training accuracy of above 90%. </p>
