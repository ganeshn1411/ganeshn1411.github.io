			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Every year, there are thousands of deaths and hunderd of thousands of accidents that happen due to unsafe driving. 
			Our project tries to combine the concepts of Computer Vision and Machine Learning to build models that can detect unsafe driving.</p>
			<h2>Approach</h2>
			<p>The diagram below demonstrates our approach that takes an image and classifies it into safe and unsafe driving.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<h3>2 class classification</h3>
			<p>Our algorithm was able to differentiate 2 classes of safe and unsafe driving very well with an accuracy of 92.4%. The table below shows the truth table values:</p>
			<div class = "table-responsive">
				<table class = "table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<th>Predicted Safe</th>
						<th>Predicted Unsafe</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Actual Safe</th>
						<td>106</td>
						<td>10</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Actual Unsafe</th>
						<td>7</td>
						<td>101</td>
					</tr>				
				</table>
			</div>
			<h3>3 class classification</h3>
			<p>While the accuracy of our 3 class classification might not look amazing, it still performed more than twice the performance of default classifier.
			In addition, our goal here is not to increase accuracy but maximize detection of unsafe driving and our algorithm does that well.
			Below is the truth table for 3 class classification with an accuracy of about 68%:</p>
			<div class = "table-responsive">
				<table class = "table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<th>Predicted Safe</th>
						<th>Predicted Calling</th>
						<th>Predicted Make-Up</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Actual Safe</th>
						<td>42</td>
						<td>6</td>
						<td>39</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Actual Calling</th>
						<td>9</td>
						<td>81</td>
						<td>3</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Actual Make-Up</th>
						<td>9</td>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>78</td>
					</tr>					
				</table>
