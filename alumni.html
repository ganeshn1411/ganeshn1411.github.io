	<h2>The Story Behind</h2>
	<p>The college Alumni Website was designed 10 years ago and had various flaws. In addition, recently the website was hacked due to insufficient security restrictions. Accounting to all this, there was a need to redesign the college alumni portal. In this regard, as part of Web application project, we took up the task of devloping this site.</p>
<p>The new website is built with html5 , css3, jQuery and Bootstrap to give the website a good look and feel and make it attractive. The responsive website can be used on any device. Various security error were corrected as the new site was designed from scratch.</p>
