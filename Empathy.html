	<h2>The Story Behind</h2>
	<p>As technology is rapidly evolving, we have machines and robots for everything. Today robots can do almost anything we can, perhaps do it even better. But the one field where robots have to catch up is empathy. We made our app Empathy during the Freedom Hack in memory of Aaron Swartz at Inmobi.
</p>
<p>
Have you watched movies and wished that you too had background music for the special moments in your life ? Well that is exactly what Empathy does. 
<br><br>The app collect user data through Facebook or Twitter. As soon a user tweets or updates their Facebook status, the app parses the texts and categorizes it into an emotion ( e.g A tweet saying "i am outraged at the way people drive on MG Road" would be categorized as anger , A status saying "watching sunsets always pleases my eyes" would be categorized as happy )
</p>
<p>We use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to categorize the text. Songs that fit the genre are crawled and saved in an index, and later played on the site using the Soundclould API.</p>
