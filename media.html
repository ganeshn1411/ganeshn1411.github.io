	<h2>The Story Behind</h2>
	<p>Staying in the Hostel, whenever we had to transfer files from one system to the other, we had to use a pen drive or a hard disk which would not be handy most of the time. On the other hand, transferring through bluetooth was slow. So we came up with an application that uses local LAN to not just transfer but also stream applications.</p>
<p>The application was developed with Node.js which created a server environment. The application can not just be used for general data files but also stream and transfer music, video files and images.</p>
